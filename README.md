# gettingandcleaningdata
This is the final project for Getting and Cleaning data. 

## The Project Requirement
1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## How The Script Works and 
The script will work as long as the script is placed under the folder of "UCI HAR Dataset", which is the zip file downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

## The Code Book
Please refer to UCI Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) for details about the variables in the dataset.
